# redux-bank-account
In this project, you'll build a simple bank account application using Redux to manage state. The goal is to simulate the functionalities of a bank account, allowing users to deposit, withdraw, and view their balance. This exercise will help you practice state management with Redux, specifically focusing on actions, reducers, and the Redux store.
